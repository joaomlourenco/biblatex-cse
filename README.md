# BibLaTeX: Council of Science Editors style

Support for **Council of Science Editors** style in BibLaTeX.


## How to use the biblatex-cse style

1. Download the `biblatex-cse.bbx` and `biblatex-cse.cbx` files and put them in your document's main diretory/folder.
1. Load `biblatex` with the option `style=biblatex-cse`, i.e.,
```latex
\usepackage[style=biblatex-cse]{biblatex}
```

## How to contribute

I did this style file by request of a user of my [https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis](LaTeX template `novathesis`). He was quite thorough, double and triple checking that the output was conforming to the requirements of his University (Faculty of Veterinary from the University of Lisbon). Although this biblatex-cse style served the requirements from his University, there may still be some unconformities to the CSE style. If you find any, please open an issue in the [https://github.com/joaomlourenco/biblatex-cse](in the project's page on GitHub) or, even better, **submit a pull request**.
